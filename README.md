# btsmarthub-utils

scripts / container that poll the BT Smart Hub 2 to get logs and internet usage per device
the logs and data can be exported to syslogs / graphite

New: a script to delete devices from the smarthub

I've only tested against this combo:
```
product_name    "HomeHub6DX"
fw_ver  "v0.16.02.08304-BT (Fri Aug 30 17:58:36 2019)"
board_ver  "R01"
gui_ver  "1.56 15_02_2019"
```

# Features

* scrape the logs displayed in the normal gui and tail -f them in the console or send to syslog

* poll the internet usage for mac addresses connected and send the metrics to graphite

* docker image to ease deployment

* delete a device from the smarthub from the command line

# manual setup

python3 

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

copy `example-config.py` to `config.py` and edit it

'hub' are the smarthub details

'logger' are the syslog server details

'colors' to change or disable colors in the tail like output

'cookies' is used for logging in to the router; urn is just a random thing - can be changed if required

'graphite' graphite server and prefix for the smarthub data ( only tested on port 2003 ) 

# cli tools

* logs-tail.py - tails the log to stdout with colors

* logs-syslog.py - send's the logs to a remote syslog server ( only tested with logstash ) 

* bandwidth-graphite.py - sends bandwidth info per mac addr to graphite

* delete-device - scripts for deleting inactive devices

see misc for other small unfinished things that may be useful

# docker 

`docker pull simonczuzu/btsmarthub-utils`

or build the image locally using the script

example docker-compose file

```yml
version: '3'

services:
    smarthub:
      image: smarthub
      container_name: smarthub
      restart: unless-stopped
      hostname: smarthub
      environment:
        - DEBUG=yes
        - URL=http://smarthub
        - SMARTHUB_NAME=smarthub
        - PASS=password
        - LOGHOST=loghost
        - LOGHOST_PORT=514
        - G_HOST=graphitehost
        - G_PREFIX=smarthub
```
setting DEBUG sends the logs and metrics reports / data to stderr

# misc smarthub info that may save you some time

I spent a few hours diagnosing why some bridge interfaces on my homelab virtualisation setup were showing dropped RX packets. I initally suspected some powerline adapters; but it turned out to be the smarthub doing this kind of thing..

I guess its something to do with whole home wifi discs. I ended up using nftables to drop them eg: 

```
#!/usr/sbin/nft -f

flush ruleset

table netdev filter {
    chain ingress {
    type filter hook ingress device enp0s25 priority 0; policy accept;
        meta protocol 0xfe68  drop
    }
}
```
