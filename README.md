# docker 

`docker pull simonczuzu/btsmarthub-utils`

or build the image locally using the script

example docker-compose file

```yml
version: '3'

services:
    smarthub:
      image: smarthub
      container_name: smarthub
      restart: unless-stopped
      hostname: smarthub
      environment:
        - DEBUG=yes
        - URL=http://smarthub
        - SMARTHUB_NAME=smarthub
        - PASS=password
        - LOGHOST=loghost
        - LOGHOST_PORT=514
        - G_HOST=graphitehost
        - G_PREFIX=smarthub
```
setting DEBUG sends the logs and metrics reports / data to stderr
